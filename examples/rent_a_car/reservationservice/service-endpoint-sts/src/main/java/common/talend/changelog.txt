    Handle auth failures more gracefully; maximum failures.
    
    This change will ensure that autentication failures do not
    hang the thread adding an operation.  The default behavior
    is to try to authenticate forever and whine to the log if
    authentication continues to fail.
    
    Optionally, a developer may define
    net.spy.memcached.auth.AuthThreshold with an integer value
    to set a maximum number of authentication attempts before
    shutting down.
    
    Authentication threads are now spawned and managed by an
    AuthTreadMonitor class, ensuring that for any given
    connection there can only be one outstanding AuthThread.

    Enhance MemcachedNode to know whether auth should happen.
    
    When SASL authentication is requested of a MemcachedClient it should
    always ensure that auth takes place before anything else on the queue
    is processed.
    
    After some experimentation, it seems The best way to handle this is to
    extend the MemcachedNode interface to add some methods. This in turn
    allows for the changes to be implemented in the TCPMemcachedNodeImpl
    class.
    
    There is special handling with the inputQueue and addOperation if
    a reconnect occurs during authentication.
    
    It's a bit harder at the BinaryMemcachedNodeImpl, though arguably
    makes more sense there.  Since these are all pretty well hidden as an
    implementation detail, it's okay for it to be here.
    
    Who knows, maybe someday ascii will have SASL.  Probably not though.

    New TCP connection timeout feature; if server fails completely, d/c.
    
    With this change, the MemcachedClient has a method of using the
    connection observer to determine a connected server is consistently
    timing out, indicating it has hard-failed.  This will destroy that
    connection so things may rehash or reconnect, depending on the hash
    behavior.

    is a feature, I thought this was a good place to show it off too.

    Handle operations that are writing and reading at the same time.
    
    Especially in bulk cases, the server can be transmitting data from an
    operation and receiving results from it simultaneously.  It's no
    longer sufficient to consider an operation to be either reading or
    writing, but it's likely that it will need to read at the very moment
    it begins writing.

    MemcachedConnection constructor should catch SocketException
    
    Running version 2.0.1 on OS X 10.5.7 with JDK 1.5, I observed the
    following exception when to a host that had been accidentally taken
    out of service:
    
    java.net.SocketException: Host is down
    	at sun.nio.ch.Net.connect(Native Method)
    	at sun.nio.ch.SocketChannelImpl.connect(SocketChannelImpl.java:464)
    	at net.spy.memcached.MemcachedConnection.<init>(MemcachedConnection.java:80)
    	at net.spy.memcached.DefaultConnectionFactory.createConnection(DefaultConnectionFactory.java:84)
    	at net.spy.memcached.MemcachedClient.<init>(MemcachedClient.java:146)
    
    It looks like the 2.4.1 client resolves this by catching
    ConnectException and queuing a reconnect, in this code:
    
    // Initially I had attempted to skirt this by queueing every
    // connect, but it considerably slowed down start time.
    try {
    	if(ch.connect(sa)) {
    		getLogger().info("Connected to %s immediately", qa);
    		connected(qa);
    	} else {
    		getLogger().info("Added %s to connect queue", qa);
    		ops=SelectionKey.OP_CONNECT;
    	}
    	qa.setSk(ch.register(selector, ops, qa));
    	assert ch.isConnected()
    		|| qa.getSk().interestOps() == SelectionKey.OP_CONNECT
    		: "Not connected, and not wanting to connect";
    } catch(ConnectException e) {
    	queueReconnect(qa);
    }
    connections.add(qa);
    
    Given the stack trace I observed, the catch of ConnectException should
    cast a slightly larger net and catch SocketException.

    Optimize binary protocol sets.
    
    This optimization works in a similar fashion to the GET optimization,
    but is binary protocol specific.  Effectively, all mutation operations
    are folded into quiet ops and the responses are dispatched as implied
    positives when the operations are known to have finished.

    Refactor optimization control.
    
    No longer a dangerous mutable field in the connection.  The

    Provide some breadcrumbs about which nodes were in contact during timeouts.
    
    The root cause of an OperationTimeoutException should have something
    that looks like this:
    
    Caused by: net.spy.memcached.internal.CheckedOperationTimeoutException:
           Timed out waiting for operation - failing node: /127.0.0.1:11213
    
    The actual failing operation is available from the
    CheckedOperationTimeoutException in case someone wants to do something
    particularly special with it.

    Note that initially tried running *all* connections through the queue,

    Fix bug when a reconnect is scheduled simultaneously for two connections.
    
    This is a time-sorted map, so adding one could kick another one out.
    As it's rare, detecting it and fudging the reconnection time is the
    least intrusive and safest way to prevent things from getting dropped.

    Allow transcoders to say how big objects they cache are.
    
    This allows someone to, for example, have a transcoder for small

    Maven uses separate classpaths for test vs main compile. This class
    didn't compile as the jmock jar is only in the test classpath.

    A Map interface to memcached.
    
    This obviously has limitations -- specifically around attempts to
    iterate the cache.  Any place where a Map is used as a cache, this
    should make a nice swap-in replacement, though.

    Allow the default transcoder to be specified.
    
    This was done before by a gross mutator.  The ability to specify it
    was obvious, but I overlooked it anyway since I always use the default
    default.

    Added the Cancel failure mode.
    
    This failure mode simply cancels any operations heading towards a
    broken server.

Date:   Fri Feb 13 10:05:26 2009 -0800

    Removed setTranscoder from client.
    
    This was not thread safe and shouldn't generally be done.  You can
    pass in a transcoder on a given operation, but attempting to change
    the current one would require me to at least make it volatile.

    Fix really terrible misspelling of mutator.
    
    This is not a backwards-compatible change, but I doubt anyone is
    implementing MutatorOperations -- at least, anyone who wouldn't prefer
    them to be spelled correctly.

    Handle multi-get dispatch fanning out into individual gets.
    
    This covers the case of a multi-get targeting a downed server, getting
    pulled out and redistributed individually to a bunch of individual
    operations on other servers.
    
    Note that this is (should be):
    
     1) Rare (you don't have servers dying a lot, do you?
     2) Later optimized into per-server multi-gets when prepped for the wire.

    Beginning of the redistribute failure strategy.
    
    This changed the default strategy used throughout tests since the new
    strategy is not complete and prematurely cancels all operations
    destined for the broken server.

    The external queue is still bounded, but the internal queues won't
    overflow by default (at the cost of more memory during spikes).

    Added the ability to pass in initial observers at construct time.
    
    With this, observers can observe the *initial* connection, which (as
    the test demonstrates) can allow a caller to block until all (or at
    least enough) connections are established before proceeding.

    If we attempt to read when we don't have anything to read, reconnect.
    
    This seems to happen in some strange server-error cases where the
    server short-circuits the connection.  This situation has shown itself
    when we've sent something too large into the server.  Precautions have
    been taken to prevent that exact thing from happening again, but this
    is a better way to handle an unexpected state.
    
    I'm not sure how we end up still having data to receive when we've
    already thrown away the ops, but tearing down the connection is a
    clean way to recover from a bad state.

    Throw an exception if we attempt to store data we know is too big.
    
    This will avoid a few problems people have encountered.  I implemented
    it with a somewhat early IllegalArgumentException because it was the
    surest way to cover every case given compression and several paths in
    to sets.

Date:   Mon May 26 23:57:28 2008 -0700

    Killed off a slightly elusive bug that was causing sporatic cancellations.
    
    Whenever a read returned in the binary protocol without having read
    enough bytes to fill a header packet, an NPE would be fired that would
    cause us to disconnect from the server and cancel all in-flight
    operations.
    
    This happened occasionally in one of my tests and was rather a pain to
    track down.  It likely never affected anyone since I doubt anyone is
    actually using the binary protocol anywhere today.

    Allow the input, op read and op write queues to be individually specified.
    
    By default, the read queue is 10% larger than the input queue.
    
    With a sufficiently large op read queue, it's possible to never
    internally overflow, but correct values are likely
    application-specific.

    Read before writes and expect IllegalStateException.
    
    These are two measures that are helping with the queue overflow
    problems.
    
    Firstly, the IllegalStateException is thrown whenever you attempted to
    add to a queue that's full.  If that happens internally, I don't want
    the IO thread to crash, so I add it to the normal ``expected
    exceptions'' list.
    
    Secondly, reading before writing helps keep the read buffer ready for
    new data.  When writing first, the write will have to transition to a
    read and may cause the read buffer to overflow.  It still may happen,
    but by servicing the reads first I can at least get the complete ones
    popped out before piling new ones in (since writes are almost always
    smaller and likely to transition).

    Turning the timeouts way up during tests.
    
    I manage to do something that slows stuff down in my full test plan
    which leads to spurious failures.
    
    This may be hinting at a bug of some type, or perhaps some bad
    defaults, but this code isn't attempting to test timeouts so they
    should never get in the way.

    Test fix.  Invalid connections shouldn't fail to shut down.
    
    I think there may be a bigger bug around this, but it only occurs when
    trying to shut down a connection that shouldn't've started due to
    someone writing a broken connection factory, so I think we can live
    with it.

    Turns out the ``not found'' error for prepend and append is different
    from that of other commands so I needed to make a case for it.

    Make zero byte packing optional in transcoder utils.

    figured out why it gives an EXISTS error, so this may be broken there.

Author: Dustin Sallings <dustin@spy.net>
Date:   Fri May 2 19:54:20 2008 -0700

    Moved operation timeout into the connection factory.
    
    It shouldn't change at runtime in a client, as the current model was
    not thread safe.  In order for this to be dynamically reconfigurable,
    the field either needs to be volatile or access to the value must be
    synchronized.
    
    By having the value be declared final and removing the mutators and
    accessors, we can guarantee correctness.

    Add parameterized versions of all the MemcachedClient methods.
    
    The new methods all take a Transcoder<T> and if they returned an
    Object, now return a T instead.
    
    The non-paramterized methods use the SerializingTranscoder which
    has T as an Object and calls the parameterized ones, so callers
    should not see a change in behavior.

commit 1ee97bc65c54ff964b1a7474f79f865524a44d4f
Author: Dustin Sallings <dustin@spy.net>
Date:   Fri Feb 29 17:50:39 2008 -0800

    Slightly cleaner shutdown sequence.
    
    This avoids a couple of the exceptions that were occuring on shutdown
    due to lack of coordination (just allowing the NIO exceptions to tear
    stuff down), and downgrades others to debug as we can expect things to
    error occasionally when the plug is pulled.

commit 3b41c02cd6f74013603106d2298e195ca53f8b47
Author: Dustin Sallings <dustin@spy.net>
Date:   Fri Feb 22 12:13:23 2008 -0800

    Use an enum instead of a boolean to indicate what happened during a CAS.
    
    There are two normal failure states which must be distinguished.  An enum
    will indicate success vs. one of the failure states.

Author: Dustin Sallings <dustin@spy.net>
Date:   Fri Feb 22 11:40:09 2008 -0800

    Use a constant for the command implementing base get in the text protocol.
    
    This change is slight, but it seems a little better to use the constant to set
    a final than to use an abstract method to get the constant.

Author: Dustin Sallings <dustin@spy.net>
Date:   Mon Feb 11 21:45:39 2008 -0800

    	Fixed a bug related to detecting timeouts of CountDownLatches.
    
    	Prior to 65ea6e61fdc2 (when I replaced my own mechanism with
    CountDownLatch), exceptions were thrown by the latch mechanism.
    
    	CountDownLatch requires you to check a return value to determine whether
    there was a timeout or the count went all the way down.
    
    	Tests were added to ensure the correctness of this behavior on all async
    calls.

    	Use consistent character sets when transcoding string values.
    
    	Defaults to UTF-8, but may be supplied at runtime.

Author: Dustin Sallings <dustin@spy.net>
Date:   Thu Jul 5 11:02:34 2007 -0700

    	Pulled QueueAttachment out into MemcachedNode.
    
    	QueueAttachment was a nested class in MemcachedConnection that was used to
    hold per-connection information.  It was called QueueAttachment because it was
    attached to the select queue or something like that.  MemcachedNode seems like
    a better name, and it's going to need to be exposed some as we get into more
    pluggable node selection algorithms.

Author: Dustin Sallings <dustin@spy.net>
Date:   Fri Jun 29 01:24:06 2007 -0700

    	Some changes to get this bench thing to run under the profiler.
    
    	There were a couple of stupidities in how the client was set up, and some
    issues keeping large numbers of async sets down.  It still doesn't model a real
    application very well, but may be good enough at showing what would happen in a
    peak situation.

commit 63215d8b3a2bd4083c8c22a2a1c6da82c74e0bb8
Author: Dustin Sallings <dustin@spy.net>
Date:   Fri Jun 29 00:08:59 2007 -0700

    	Support for working around a failing server.
    
    	Apparently, the common thing to do is check the status of a server when
    performing a command against it, and trying the next server in the list when
    the server is unavailable.
    
    	My previous behavior was to queue a command against a server regardless of
    its status such that when a server was available the command would be processed
    as close to immediately as contention would allow, but when a server was
    unavailable, the command would wait around for the server to come back up.
    
    	The new behavior is something near the middle of this.  When a server is
    unavailable, I'll try the next server in the list.  I repeat until I've
    exhausted every known server and then just queue it for the one to which it
    belonged in the first place.

    	Thanks to murugac@gmail.com for pointing out this problem.

    	Trying to arrange buffers for writes before sending them.
    
    	This is broken right now since copying one buffer into another without
    checking the size causes a BufferOverflowException.  After covering that, I've
    got some measurements to perform.
    
    	This may conflict with get optimization.

Date:   Mon Apr 2 12:53:20 2007 -0700

    	Unit tests centered around an actual memcached plus a couple bug fixes this
    found.
    
    	I really don't like having unit tests rely on network resources, but a
    dedicated memcached on localhost is obviously better than not having one at all
    (based on my unit tests).  I still don't have a way to model the various
    failure modes I have code to support, though.

    	When we receive data when we're not expecting to do so, log what we
    receive.
    
    	This revealed a strange condition where a server gave us an error while we
    were transmitting data.  I don't know exactly what caused this error
    (SERVER_ERROR object too large for cache).  I'm feeding it what I think is my
    largest object, but it doesn't break.  Will have to experiment more.
