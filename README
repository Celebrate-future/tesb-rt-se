Welcome to Talend ESB SE!
=====================================

Talend ESB SE includes: Service Factory + Integration Factory + AMQ,
Camel 3rd party libraries, Service Locator, Service Activity Monitoring

Talend Service Factory uses the industry leading 
open source Apache CXF implementation of JAX-WS to help you service enable 
your existing applications and interfaces. The CXF lightweight, modular 
architecture is based on Spring, so it will work with your application 
regardless of the platform on which it is running. It will run on 
stand-alone JVM applications, as part of a servlet container such as 
Tomcat, within a JEE server, or in an OSGi container such as Equinox.

CXF supports Web Services using 
SOAP with full WS-*functionality including support for WS-Addressing,
WS-Reliable Messaging, and WS-Security over both HTTP and JMS transports.
CXF's elegantly simple architecture allows declarative, policy-centric 
support of these qualities of service through configuration rather than 
code. It also supports non-SOAP bindings including REST. CXF open 
standards and portability enable you to deliver interoperability for 
your applications to maximize the value of your application to your users.

Talend Integration Factory is a fully supported,
stable, production ready distribution based on the industry leading open
source integration framework Apache Camel. Apache Camel uses well known 
Enterprise Integration Patterns to make message based system 
integration simpler yet powerful and scalable. 

The Apache Camel uses a lightweight, component based architecture 
which allows a great flexibility in deployment scenarios: as stand-alone
JVM applications or embedded in a servlet container such as Tomcat,
or within a JEE server, or in an OSGi container such as Equinox. 

Apache Camel and Talend Integration Factory come out of the box with 
an impressive set of available components for all commonly used protocols 
like http, https, ftp, xmpp, rss and many more. A large number of data
formats like EDI, JSON, CSV, HL7 and languages like JS, Python, 
Scala, are supported out of the box. Its extensible architecture
allows developers to easily add support for proprietary protocols
and data formats.

Apache CXF
==========

This package contains a complete version of Apache CXF, the industry 
leading open source solution for web services. It also includes value
added components such as OSGi container and several new examples.
For more information about Apache CXF see http://cxf.apache.org/ .

OSGi container 
============== 

The container subdirectory contains a preconfigured OSGi container that 
contains all the required OSGi bundles for the CXF 3rd party dependencies.
It also includes Apache Karaf to provide easy administration and 
configuration. For more information about OSGi and Apache 
Karaf see http://karaf.apache.org/ .

OSGi provides a mature, open standards based, highly modular framework for 
managing component dependencies, service invocation, and lifecycles. It is 
the basis for Eclipse and provides a lightweight alternative to more 
monolithic JEE containers while still retaining the powerful management 
features necessary for the enterprise.
