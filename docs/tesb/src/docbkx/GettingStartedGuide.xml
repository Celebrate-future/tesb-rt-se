        <title>Overview</title>
        <para>The Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) has always been the
            cornerstone of every vendor&apos;s Service Oriented Architecture
            (SOA) strategy. In the past, however, ESBs have often failed to
            help leverage the full value of SOA. This was due to their large
            footprint, centralized architecture, and considerable effort
            required to properly integrate them into an existing application
            landscape. Unlike these ESB solutions Talend ESB has relatevely
            small size, using of proven open source technologies allows to
            create and coordinate work of distributed, highly reliable business
            applications without much effort.</para>
        <para>In this Getting Started Guide you will learn about Talend
            ESB/CXF. This guide contains a simplified real-world example, using
            the domain of car rental companies to demonstrate the use of Talend
            ESB for developing and deploying services.</para>
        <para>You will first learn the design of the Rent a Car Demo. Then we will show how to
            compile the demo, deploy it into the Talend ESB Runtime OSGi container and then activate
            it. You will also learn how to enable the Service Locator Component for the Rent a Car
            demo, and how Service Activity Monitoring can be enabled.</para>

        <title>Rent a Car Demo Example</title>
        <para>For this demo example we have chosen a common business use
            case scenario: a simplified real-world example from the domain of
            car rental companies.</para>

                <imagedata fileref="images/schema.jpg" format="jpg"/>
            </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
        <para>In the course of working through this example you will learn
            how to:</para>
        <simplelist columns="1" type="vert">
            <member>compile and build Apache CXF services,</member>
            <member>deploy services using the Karaf OSGi console,</member>
            <member>use OSGi commands</member>
        </simplelist>
        <para>In this scenario, there are two main services that will be
            demonstrated, CRMService and ReservationService. You will create
            and orchestrate these services with the help of a simple graphical
            front-end application.</para>
        <para>Rental Client provides the basic functionality to search for
            the available cars within a given time period. The search takes
            into account the status (silver, gold, platinum) of the given user.
            This criteria will then determine the outcome of the search. From
            the list of results you can select the car that best fulfills your
            requirements and then make your reservation simply by clicking on
            the &quot;Book&quot; button. At the end of the submission process,
            the system will show you a confirmation page with your Reservation
            ID. To implement its business logic the client calls operations of
            both the CRM Service and the Reservation Service.</para>

            <title>System Requirements</title>
            <para>The Talend ESB and examples can be installed, built, and run on Windows or
                UNIX-style operating systems for which Java 6 is available. The following software
                is required for installing, building, and running the samples:</para>
            <procedure>
                <step>
                    <para>JDK 1.6.0 from Oracle should be installed, and the environment variable
                        <code>JAVA_HOME</code> should be set to the JDK installation directory.
                        Later JDKs from Oracle or JDKs from other providers may work but have not
                        been tested.</para>
                </step>
                <step>
                    <para>Maven 3.0.3 or better from Apache should be installed, and the
                        <code>mvn</code> executable should be in your <code>PATH</code>. When
                        running <code>mvn</code>, HTTP access to the internet is required.</para>

        <section>
            <title>Installation of the Talend ESB</title>
            <para>The Talend ESB is provided as two archives. For Windows,
                these are <code>talend-esb-&lt;version&gt;.zip</code> and
                <code>talend-esb-&lt;version&gt;-doc.zip</code>, for
                UNIX/Linux <code>talend-esb-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz</code>
                and <code>talend-esb-&lt;version&gt;-doc.tar.gz</code>
                (<code>&lt;version&gt;</code> is replaced by the ESB version,
                e.g. &quot;<code>4.0</code>&quot;). Both archives should be
                unpacked to a directory of your choice. There, a directory
                <code>talend-esb-&lt;version&gt;</code> is created which
                contains ESB and examples. Directory paths mentioned in the
                following chapters will by default be relative to this
                directory.</para>
