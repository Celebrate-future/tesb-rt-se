  <title>Enabling the STS for the Rent a Car demo</title>

  <section>
    <title>Purpose of the STS</title>

    <para>In a heterogeneous environment Web services need to authenticate
    service clients to control their access. To negotiate trust between
    service clients and service providers an authentication broker can provide
    a common access control infrastructure for a group of applications. To
    negotiate trust the authentication broker issues signed security tokens to
    be used by clients to authenticate themselves at the service. </para>

    <para>A STS (Security Token Service) is a service providing such an
    authentication broker. It issues Security Tokens based on the WS-Trust, a
    standardized specification of Web services based on WS-Security. WS-Trust
    combines two related functions. </para>

    <para>The first function is to support working with security tokens â€”
    specifically, the issuing, renewing, and canceling of security tokens. The
    second function is to support brokering trust relationships. These two
    functions may seem different, but they interrelate in that security tokens
    must be trusted, and some form of token represents trust. </para>

    <para>The core of WS-Trust is a set of messages used to issue, renew,
    cancel, and validate security tokens. Clients calling a SOAP web service
    called Security Token Service (STS) exchange these messages. The received
    tokens are used for authentication. They may be transferred for instance
    inside a security header of a request to another service.</para>

    <para>An STS is implements a simple interface defined by the WS-Trust
    specification. This interface allows clients to use security tokens to
    submit requests for several types of operations. WS-SecurityPolicy can be
    used to specify the types of credentials to be provided by clients or any
    other security processing required on the messages. </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Advantages of using STS </title>

    <para>For a web service and its client to communicate securely there needs
    to be a trust relationship established between the service and the client.
    If the service and client are in the same security domain they can have a
    direct trust relationship. In this type of relationship the service and
    client can authenticate each other directly. But if the client and the
    service placed in different security domains they not have direct trust
    relationship.</para>

    <para> You can use an STS to make trusted connection between it. STS also
    used to issue a security token, that is, a collection of claims such as
    name, role, and authorization code, for the client to access the
    service.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>How it works </title>

    <para>The client sends an authentication request, with credentials, to the
    STS. The STS verifies the credentials presented by the client, and sends
    back a response with security token that provides proof that the client
    has authenticated with the STS. The client presents the security token to
    the Web service. The Web service verifies that the token was issued by a
    trusted STS, which proves that the client has successfully authenticated
    with the STS.</para>

    <para>The protocol used for issuing security tokens is based on WS-Trust.
    WS-Trust is a Web service specification that builds on WS-Security. It
    describes a protocol used for issuance, exchange, and validation of
    security tokens. WS-Trust provides a solution for interoperability by
    defining a protocol for issuing and exchanging security tokens, based on
    token format.</para>

    <para>In WS-Trust, the type of message sent to an STS to request issuance
    of a security token is known as a Request Security Token (RST) message.
    The RST message contains credentials for the client to be authenticated,
    such as the user ID and password contained in a UsernameToken. The
    response message from the STS is known as a Request Security Token
    Response (RSTR) message. The RSTR contains a security token, such as an
    XML Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). </para>

    <para>SAML tokens provide cross-platform interoperability and exchange
    security information between clients and services in different security
    domains. They can be used as part of an interoperability solution allowing
    a client to talk to services running on disparate technologies.</para>

    to the STS. Step 2. The STS validates the client's credentials. Step 3.
    The STS issues a security token to the client. Step 4. The client
    initializes and sends a request message to the service. Step 5. The
    service validates the security token and processes the request. Step 6.
    The service initializes and sends a response message to the client.

    <title>Installation prerequisites</title>

    <para>To enable the Rent-a-Car example initially prepare and run the STS
    server. For more information please read CXF STS server Installation and
    Configuration Manual. Implementation of STS server is integrated with the
    open source technology service framework - CXF. This is a highly reliable
    and available framework that incorporates the modern standards of
    web-services technologies . To learn more about CXF. </para>

        <para>Prepairing the consumer keystore and properties: Sample consumer

        <para>Prepairing the client keystore and properties: Sample serivce
        keystore for the CRM service is located in
        crmservice\service\src\main\resources\META-INF\spring\. It contains
        two files: clientstore.jks and clientKeystore.properties.</para>

      </step>

      <step>
        <para>Prepairing policies for the client and service. </para>

        <para>WS-SecureConversation in theory can be used with multiparty
        message exchanges, but the most common usage is for a client
        communicating with a single server. When used in this configuration,
        the STS that supplies the SCT to the client is co-located with the
        server, accessed at the same endpoint address. This means that the web
        services code on the server needs a way to distinguish between
        messages intended for the STS and those intended for the service
        itself; the action used on the request serves that purpose.</para>

        <para>A major part of the WS-Security performance cost comes from the
        wide use of asymmetric encryption. Asymmetric encryption is a useful
        tool because it works with key pairs. Each key in the pair can be used
        to encrypt messages that the other key can decrypt. The owner of a key
        pair can make one key publicly available so that anyone can use it to
        encrypt messages to the owner securely, and also decrypt messages from
        the owner (thereby verifying the sender's identity).</para>

        <para>WS-SecureConversation uses WS-Policy and WS-SecurityPolicy
        configurations that are similar to those used by the basic
        WS-Security. A big difference is that when WS-SecureConversation is
        used, the policy must cover two separate exchanges â€” that between the
        client and the STS, and that between the client and the actual
        service. This is handled in the policy description by using a nested
        policy for the exchange with the STS, while the main body of the
        policy applies to the exchange between the client and the
        service.</para>

        <para>Add policies to the file
        ../examples/crmservice/common/src/main/resources/model/CRMService.wsdl
        </para>

        <para>Use the prepared file CRMService_policies.wsdl in the same
        directory as an example how to add policies in the crmservice WSDL
        file.</para>

        <para>For additional information about policies using in CXF please
        read: http://cxf.apache.org/docs/ws-securitypolicy.html and
        http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-securitypolicy/200702/ws-securitypolicy-1.2-spec-os.html</para>
